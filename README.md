Dead I am the one
exterminating son
Slipping through the trees
stranglin the breeze

Dead I am the sky
watchin angels cry
While they slowly turn
conquering the worrrrrrrm
Dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches
and slam in the back of my
Dragula
Dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches
and slam in the back of my
Dragula

Dead I am the pool
draining from the fool
Weak and want you need
nowhere as you bleed

Dead I am the rat
feast upon the cat
Tender is the fur
dying as you purrrrrrrrr
Dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches
and slam in the back of my
Dragula
Dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches
and slam in the back of my
Dragula
Do it Baby, Do it Baby
Do it Baby, Do it Baby
burn like an animal

Dead I am the knife
dig into the skin
Knuckle crack the bone
21 to win

Dead I am the dog
hound of hell you cry
Devil on your back
I can never die
Dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches
and slam in the back of my
Dragula
Dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches
and slam in the back of my
Dragula
Do it Baby, Do it Baby
Do it Baby, Do it Baby
burn like an animal
Dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches
and slam in the back of my
Dragula
Dig through the ditches
and burn through the witches
and slam in the back of my
Dragula
